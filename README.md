Abstract

Individual religiosity measures are used by researchers to describe and compare individuals and societies. However, the cross-cultural comparability of the mea- sures has often been questioned but rarely empirically tested. In the current study, we examined the cross-national measurement invariance properties of generalized individual religiosity in the sixth wave of the World Values Survey. For the analysis, we used multiple group confirmatory factor analysis and align- ment. Our results demonstrated that a theoretically driven measurement model was not invariant across all countries. We suggested four unidimensional mea- surement models and four overlapping groups of countries in which these mea- surement models demonstrated approximate invariance. The indicators that covered praying practices, importance of religion, and confidence in its institu- tions were more cross-nationally invariant than other indicators.
